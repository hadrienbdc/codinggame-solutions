# Personal CodingGame Solutions

CodingGame is a platform for computer programming where you solve coding challenges same as HackerRank or Codewars. The level of problems is between easy and hard. The main advantage of the platform is the gamification of challenges.

There are only solutions to training problems.
I don't share solutions to competition problems for fairness reasons.

Check it out at https://www.codingame.com/ !
